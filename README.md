Admittedly it's been a very long time since I've looked at this code and while I know the Volume Renderer is written in C++, requires compilation in CMake and uses VTK. I do not recall exactly what else is required to work for the environment, but I believe that is it if you wish to make it work. 

This did work and reached the end goal image also packaged in the ZIP file.
